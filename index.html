                    <p>Although writing too short is not advised, neither is it advised to write too long. The resolution to this is breaking the long content into sections of content that makes actual sense and is easy to understand by viewers.</p>
                    <p>USE MORE TRANSITION WORDS: A transition word or phrase is one that assists connect two sentences, paragraphs, or sections of a piece. In addition, using transition words can advance your content’s arrangement and hence increasing readability.
